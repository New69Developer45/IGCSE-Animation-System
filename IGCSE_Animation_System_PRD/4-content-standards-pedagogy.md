# 4. Content Standards & Pedagogy

## 4.1 Academic Accuracy Requirements

**Subject Matter Experts:**
All content must reflect the understanding of a seasoned IGCSE examiner with:
- Deep knowledge of subject specifications
- Familiarity with common student errors
- Understanding of mark scheme application
- Awareness of question difficulty progression

**Fact-Checking Protocol:**
- Numerical calculations must be verified programmatically
- Chemical equations must be balanced
- Physics equations must use correct SI units
- Biological classifications must follow current nomenclature
- All claims must be verifiable against IGCSE specifications

**Specification Depth Alignment:**
```
IGCSE Depth Levels:
1. Recall: State, name, identify → Brief definition (5-10s)
2. Understanding: Describe, explain → Mechanism/reasoning (15-25s)
3. Application: Calculate, predict, deduce → Worked example (30-45s)
4. Analysis: Compare, evaluate → Multi-step reasoning (45-60s)
```

## 4.2 Pedagogical Approach

**Explanation Structure (The "3E" Model):**
1. **Establish:** Set up the problem and identify what's being asked (10-15s)
2. **Explain:** Show the reasoning process step-by-step (30-60s)
3. **Emphasize:** Highlight the key insight or examiner expectation (10-15s)

**Examiner Tips Integration:**
- Limit to 1-2 tips per video
- Display for 3-5 seconds
- Use yellow highlight box with "Examiner Tip" label
- Examples:
  - "Keywords matter: 'temporary' vs 'permanent'"
  - "Show your working for partial credit"
  - "Check units in your final answer"

**Misconception Treatment:**
Format: "Common Error" → "Why It Fails" → "Correct Approach"
- Show the error briefly (8-10s)
- Use visual cues (reduced opacity, cross-out) to signal incorrectness
- Never dwell on errors longer than the correct solution
