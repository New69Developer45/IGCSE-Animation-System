# 2. Project Objectives

## Core Objectives

1. **Provide Clear Context**
   - Each animation must immediately establish the subject, topic, and IGCSE paper type
   - Questions must be presented as authentically as possible to resemble actual exam format
   - Visual context must orient viewers within IGCSE curriculum structure

2. **Design Question-Appropriate Animations**
   - Different animation strategies for different question types and subjects
   - Visual style must match the cognitive load and complexity of the question
   - Diagrams must replicate exam paper layout and presentation conventions

3. **Ensure Academic Rigor**
   - Explanations must be factually accurate and align with IGCSE mark schemes
   - Content depth must match typical IGCSE specification requirements
   - Language and approach must reflect what a seasoned IGCSE examiner would provide

4. **Apply Instructional Design Principles**
   - Cognitive load theory: Avoid split attention, manage intrinsic/extraneous load
   - Multimedia learning principles: Coherence, signaling, segmenting, pre-training
   - Deliberate practice: Highlight key decision points and common errors

5. **Maintain Professional UI/UX Standards**
   - Clean, uncluttered visual hierarchy
   - Consistent branding and color usage
   - Mobile-first design for social media consumption
   - Accessibility considerations (clear text, sufficient contrast)

6. **Produce High-Quality Manim Code**
   - Professional-grade rendering quality
   - Efficient code structure and reusability
   - Smooth animations with appropriate timing
   - Proper mathematical typography and scientific notation

7. **Integrate Supporting Libraries**
   - py3Dmol for 3D molecular visualization (Chemistry)
   - VPython for 3D physics simulations
   - matplotlib/plotly for data visualization
   - NumPy/SciPy for computational accuracy

8. **Optimize for Multiple Platforms**
   - Generate 1:1 (square), 9:16 (vertical), and 4:5 (portrait) aspect ratios
   - Platform-specific optimizations for TikTok and Facebook
   - Include .srt caption files for accessibility
   - 60-120 second duration range
